Background:
  What are quantum computers?
  How are they different from current digital computers?

Current State:
  Security is offered by:
    integer factorization problem (RSA)
    discret logarithm problem (El Gamal)
    elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem (?)
  Issues:
    Simple algorithm to solve these problems
    Computationally difficult to solve these problems

Post-Quantum Computer Solutions:
